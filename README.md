# Partitioning Trick

UPPAAL models are saved as "x Partitioned.xml" for x ∈ {BB, RW}

Strategies can be viewed with "x StrategyVisualisation.jl" for x ∈ {RW} using [Pluto Notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) 

 - [x] Partitioned BB
 - [ ] BB strategy visualisation (I have some copy-pasta from this)
 - [x] Partitioned RW
 - [ ] RW strategy visualisation
 - [ ] Picking point in partition other than random one
 - [ ] (many steps to this one) Automatically run UPPPAL models to produce figures
